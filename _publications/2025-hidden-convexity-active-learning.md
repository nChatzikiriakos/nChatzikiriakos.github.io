excerpt: 'The goal of this work is to accelerate the identification of an unknown ARX system from trajectory data through online input design. Specifically, we present an active learning algorithm that sequentially selects the input to excite the system according to an experiment design criterion using the past measured data. The adopted criterion yields a non-convex optimization problem, but we provide an exact convex reformulation allowing to find the global optimizer in a computationally tractable way. Moreover, we give sample complexity bounds on the estimation error due to the stochastic noise. Numerical studies showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm and the benefits of the convex reformulation.'
