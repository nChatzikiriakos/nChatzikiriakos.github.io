I am a PhD student at the [Insitute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de), University of Stuttgart,
where I am part of the TASAS group under the supervision of [Andrea Iannelli](https://andreaian.github.io/).

I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Engineering Cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart, focusssing on system theory, control engineering as well as machine learning. 
Currently, my [research](research) mostly focusses on combining these tools with methods from statistical learning theory to characterize the uncertainty and statistical hardness of data-driven methods for dynamical systems.
