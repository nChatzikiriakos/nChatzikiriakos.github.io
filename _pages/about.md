I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Engineering Cybernetics at the University of Stuttgart, focusing on system theory, control engineering as well as machine learning. 
Currently, my [research](research) mostly focuses on combining these tools with methods from statistical learning theory to characterize the uncertainty and statistical hardness of data-driven methods for dynamical systems.
